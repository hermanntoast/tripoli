# TRIPOLI - Create XFCE Shell extentions

Inspired by https://github.com/p-e-w/argos I write this application. You can build a plugin with the content of any shell script for your xFCE desktop based on GTK. The hole project is written in python. If you have any idea to improve or extend the code, feel free to write me at dev@hermann-toast.de.

## Installation

1. Download DEB-File and install it `dpkg -i <FILENAME>`
2. Place your scripts in this location: `~/.config/tripoli/`

## Roadmap
- add HTML support for the output
- add action on menuitem click
- improve error handling
- create service with automatic startup
- build package for easy installation
- create packageserver to provide package and updates
